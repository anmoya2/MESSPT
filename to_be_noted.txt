Gp and rolling_window values for each dataset:
	- Generally, values are 500 and 1000 instances respectively. However, some datasets include lower number of instances and they are lower.
	- For ENRON dataset, 100 and 100 are these values.
	- For Cardio, 75 and 100.
	- For Bias: 250 and 500.
	- For Garment: 30 and 60. 

In all datasets, categorical variables are transformed using One Hot Encoder. Moreover, datatime is changed to timestamp. Specifically, some extra information is necessary:
	- In Postures, missing values are replaced by 0.
	- In Sgemm first run is used as target.
	- In Transcoding, utime is used as target. id and umem are not taken into account.
	- In Bias, first, second and last columns are removed. Next_Tmax is the target.
	- In Tetuan, Zone 1 is used as target.
	- In Garment, Nas values are replaced by -200.
