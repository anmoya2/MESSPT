# MESSPT

MESSPT is the algorithm presented in paper titled: " Improving hyper-parameter self-tuning for data streams by adapting an evolutionary approach". Regarding files and directories included:

  - **Ouput files** includes all outputs related to each dataset.
  - **Output rolling** includes arrays which are saved from each run. It allows check how the metric (rolling) evolves with the progress of time.
  - **Classification and regression test files** are the main files to test each algorithm. 
  - **Sspt, random\_s and micro\_ev\_de files** include the algorithms used for our paper. Micro\_ev\_de includes MESSPT algorithm.
  - **To\_be\_noted.txt** file include this and other important information related to some parameteres for each dataset. The access to each dataset is included into original paper.
